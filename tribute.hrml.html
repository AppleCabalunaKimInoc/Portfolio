		<h1>A TRIBUTE LETTER</h1><br><br>
	<h2>
		My Dear,</h2><br>

<h2>I never knew how joyful life could be until I saw your face. My heart leaps in my chest every time I see you, and I have to say, I've never had this feeling with anyone before.</h2>

<h2>When I think about you and our rich conversations, I feel a warmness inside.</h2> <h2>It feels like we can talk about anything, even though we haven't known each other for that long.</h2> <h2>Our connection is profound to me.</h2> <h2>Every time I think about you, especially the way you look so lovely when you laugh, I can't hide my smile.</h2> <h2>Thinking about you makes me so happy, even when we are apart.</h2><br>

<h2>People keep asking what happened to create this new and better me.</h2> <h2>They wonder why I'm smiling more.</h2> <h2>I tell them, without hesitation, it is you.</h2>

<h2>Sometimes I feel like my heart will burst with all the longing and excitement I feel when I think of you.</h2> <h2>Looking forward to seeing you soon.</h2><br>

<h2>With so much joy because of you.
	</h2></div>
